# ai_agent_research
This is a repository of my agentic ai workflows I use in my research.

If anyone would like to replicate this, just keep in mind you will have to have your OWN api key to access
any of the LLM's used in this experiment. Also creating your own environmental variables and file
is mandatory as you can not use the ones in this repot.
